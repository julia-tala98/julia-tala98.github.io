   <h1>Disease and Pests</h1>
   <p>	Increasingly, honey bees are drawing the attention they so deserve. Honey bees are an incredible creature! Every living thing depends on pollination to survive, whether it is the plants that directly benefit or the creatures that consume the plants and the fruit they produce. Honey bees also obviously produce the delicious honey that millions across the world use and enjoy. Not to be forgotten, the bee's wax can be used for various things including candles and water retardant! These small creatures may seem scary with their stingers, but they fuel the world! </p>
    <h2>Origins</h2>
   <p>All honey bees belong to the genus Apis which is distinguished by containing honey producers as well as colonial and perennial combs created using wax. There are around 7 species of honey bee. All most likely originated in Southeastern Asia. There is very little evidence to show that honey bees lived in the Americas until the Europeans introduced A. Mellifera to the environment wherein they thrived thereafter. Only two species of honey bee have actually been fully domesticated, but beekeeping is an ancient practice, dating all the way back to the times of the Egyptian pyramids.</p>
