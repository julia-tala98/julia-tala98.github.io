        <p>This page works through the use of Scalable Vector Graphics or SVG. All of this page is pure coding, including all images as well as words, putting the different words and shapes in various id's and classes. The different graphs and their respective coding are grouped in group tags and contained in different id’s of infographic_large, infographic_medium, and inforgraphic_small. Once the different codes are put into different id’s then max width can be set through an @ media rule so that when the window is at a certain pixel size, only one of the graphics will show up. This is useful because throught the use of this rule, depending one the size of a devices screen or the size of a browser window, the graphic will fit and the information will be displayed clearly. </p>
