# Why Do Honey Bees Matter?

Honey bees are the workers of the world. Without them, life would likely change radically everywhere to exist *everywhere.* My goal is to educaute people on the honey bee's importance in a **convenient** as well as **aesthetically pleasing** way. Also, within my website I included details on how you can make your home a safe enviroment for honey bees and all pollinators. Below you will find a link to my website which I created in a high school web development class.

To create a cohesive and nice-looking page I have used images from other websites. Below are the links to the pages I borrowed images from.
